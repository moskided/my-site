      <h2>How I Started My Tech Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I started my coding career at 24 years of age.<br />I went to Yomfield
        nur/pry school and attended Abeokuta Grammar School.My tertiary
        education system looks noisy and the road have been like one who
        resemble a path to hell!.<br />
        I started as a Mechanical Engineering Student at the Polytechnic of
        Ibadan,finished my ND2 and later applyied for a university examination
        in which i gained admission into Olabisi Onabanjo University.<br />
        Things didn't go well as planned, so i had to forfeit my program as a
        mathematics student. It was after then a friend spoke to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a friend named Steven Kolawole,he has been a good friend
        really.<br />We actually went to the same secondary school.In a
        nutshell, he has been the one who convinced me looking into coding. He
        told me Tobi,why don't you look into a front end coding career <br />
        cause i know you like being with the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        It haven't been easy actually.But i kept fighting the battle.I started
        with working with HTML and now am on CSS,in due time will be starting my
        JAVASCRIPT language
